They then get shaped by hand and finished.<br\/><br\/>The bats are then shipped to New Zealand, where they go through all of our quality checks given a final grade put into stock.

A heavier bat will not be comparatively easy to middle the ball with, but it will stay hit when you connect with it.<br\/><br\/>Light (2lbs 6oz - 2lbs 8oz): We recommend this weight range if you are moving to your first full-size bat or into the finishing stages of your playing career, as it may help if you carry a lingering injury<br\/><br\/>Standard (2lbs 9oz - 2lbs 10oz): Most professional cricketers use a bat of this weight. It is an excellent balance between bat speed and bat performance.<br\/><br\/>Heavy (2lbs 11oz +): From 2lbs 11oz, you get a bat less about bat speed and more about blade performance.
